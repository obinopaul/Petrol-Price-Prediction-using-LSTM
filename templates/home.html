                <p class="note">This is a univariate timeseries prediction of crude oil price using LSTM. The training data was acquired from a public database and may be inaccurate. The data ranged from 2003 to 2015. </p> 
                <p class="note">Also note that there are many other factors that can determine crude prices such as OPEC production cuts, Geopolitical tensions, Global supply and demand, Speculations etc.</p> 
                <p class="note">The predicted prices from this model should therefore only be used for educational purposes. </p>
                <p class="note">For more information on how this model was built, check out <a href="https://github.com/obinopaul/Petrol-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM.git">Github repository</a>.</p>
